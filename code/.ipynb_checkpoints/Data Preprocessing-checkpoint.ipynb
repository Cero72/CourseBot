    "  - Connect concepts across different topics\n",
    "  - Include course-specific terminology\n",
    "  - Explain principles thoroughly\n",
    "\n",
    "3. MCQ Specifics:\n",
    "  - Clear, natural language\n",
    "  - Plausible distractors\n",
    "  - Similar-length options\n",
    "  - One definitively correct answer\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Open-ended Specifics:\n",
    "  - Analytical depth\n",
    "  - Real-world applications\n",
    "  - Integration of concepts\n",
